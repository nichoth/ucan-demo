        <p>
            The thing about country clubs is that you need to be invited by
            someone who is already a member.
        </p>

        <p>
            We are using an invitation code here. This code would be sent 
            to the server along with the new user's DID. The server can then
            create a UCAN for this DID. Here we are using a server-owned UCAN 
            as the 'parent' for the new UCAN we are creating. But in real-life
            it could be better to just keep a list of DIDs that are allowed
            to use this server. That way you don't have to store a keypair
            for this server anywhere (it's always better to not risk losing 
            a key because you don't even have a key.)
        </p>

        <p>
            Creating an invitation code is nice because it could be just
            emailed to a new user and placed in a query parameter in a link
            that the new user clicks on. It seems like you would want to use 
            the UCAN of the user that is inviting a new user as the 'proof' 
            field in a new UCAN, however that's more difficult because the 
            existing user would need to know a DID for the new user, and we 
            have no way of doing that since the new user may have never
            visited this website before, and we don't want the server to ever
            be able to see the private key of a new user.
        </p>

        <p>
            UCANs allow you to use an existing UCAN as 'proof' for the new 
            UCAN you are creating. That means that the child UCAN can only
            have permissions that are equal or lesser than the parent UCAN.
            So the 'capabilities' key must have a subset of the parent; it 
            can't have anything not in the parent.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <p>
            In real life, you could choose to keep invitation codes hashed
            with <code>bcrypt</code> in a JSON file in the repo, that way
            they would be usable in a serverless setting without needing
            to call a database. However, in this mode only the server 
            operator would be able to add new invitation codes. We might
            want anyone who is already a member to be able to create
            invitations. In that case you would want to create a random code
            and then hash it and save the hash to a database.
